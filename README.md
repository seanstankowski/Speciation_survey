  this file contains aswers to all of the survey questions, except for the study organisms. Several people contacted us indicating that they could easily be      indentified based on their combination of study organimsms, so we are not circulting these answers. Also, we will not circulate conuntry of origin, because we dont not think its ethical to judge repondents based on their country of origin. If you sould like to know something specific aboyt these data, will happily send you the results in a way that protects the personal and cultural identity of the repondents.
